It's important to note the distinctions not just between players' positions, but also the strengths and weaknesses of players _within_ each position.\n",
    "\n",
    "Consider for example, the retired player Shaquille O'Neal, who is regarded as one of the greatest players in NBA history. He commanded a very high field goal percentage largely due to his ability to score dunks and hook shots near the basket. Unfortunately he was also notorious for his lack of ability to score free throws. Another example is former MVP Stephen Curry, who is known as a sharpshooter all around the court, from under the rim, to behind the line, to the foul line. His weakness lies in his defensive ability, so his teammates generally cover that responsibility. Both players scarcely played outside of their roles as center and point guard, respectively, making them 'specialists' in that regard.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is important to note the changes happening within the game itself over time when determining the composition of a team. More recently, the game has evolved to allow for players who are able to shift roles. Draymond Green, who has been deployed as both power forward and a slightly under-sized center, illustrates the versatility that is necessary in the game today. A look at his position in the heatmap above shows that none of the bases describe the majority of his game. As a center, although he may not command the size and power than other centers possess, he does have a playmaking sense, nimbleness and ability to score at distance that most in the position lack.\n",

    "#### Further Questions\n",
    "\n",
    "Considering both of these points, I realize that it's actually possible to build a capable team both with 'specialists' like Shaq or Curry, and more versatile players like Green--but having a team full of players who are 'masters of none' may not necessarily be a viable strategy. It would be interesting to try and quantify the relationship between a team's success and the number of specialists vs versatile players it has. "
