The correlation matrix $R$ better shows how the shooting patterns of one individual relate to another, so it can help with differentiating between individuals, but not between types of players.\n",

For example, if you want to look at the different shooting patterns of say, all of the shooting guards who played in the 2016-2017 season, then you would create a correlation matrix of those such players to see which players resemble each other, and perhaps visualize their individual patterns to establish similarities and differences.

It is notable then, that the information on `fastbreakdata.com` (from the link) comes to a similar conclusion--that there are 8 kinds of players in the game, even though there are 5 positions.
